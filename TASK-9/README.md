# Figma Wireframe

This project contains a wireframe designed using Figma to visualize the layout and structure of the application before development.  
It focuses on the overall user interface flow, component placement, and basic design hierarchy.

## Features
- Clear representation of the application's layout and navigation.
- Organized design structure for better development planning.
- Easy-to-understand visual guide for UI elements.

## Tools Used
- Figma (for creating the wireframe)

## Usage
- Open the Figma file or link to view the wireframe.
- Use it as a reference during development to maintain design consistency.

## Future Improvements
- Add high-fidelity mockups with colors, fonts, and images.
- Create interactive prototypes to simulate user flow.
